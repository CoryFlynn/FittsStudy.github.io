      Summary:<br>
      Operating Question:<br>
      Is a trackpad easier to control standing or sitting?<br>
      <br>
	    Setup:
		  <p> To test this question, two college students were asked to complete the GoFittz Application test, designed by Scott MacKenzie.
        The first participant tested the condition of sitting down before attempting the test standing. The second participant reversed the order of events.
        When sitting down, the computer was resting on a desk. When standing, the computer was held for the participant. The result were conflicting as the
        first participant had a better throughput sitting while the second participant recorded a better throughput standing. Because both participants were
        better their first attempt, difficulty arises in discerning issues from the testing process.</p>
